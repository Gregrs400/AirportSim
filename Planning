Multiple Airport program run process

- Planes get to gates

- Planes have flights generated per day

- Flights store the time they end, so next flight can be generated from that point

- All Passengers for day created before they enter airport, in 2d ArrayList
    - get transferred to paxInAirport when they arrive
    - passenger generation based on flights that will leave within the next 4 hours, stored in ArrayList
    - flights will be deleted from ArrayList as they fill up
    - need to figure out maximum time needed to get to gate, to determine minimum time of flight departure for passenger assignment

- Flights generated
- ArrayList of flights passed to paxArrival for generating movingPax 2d ArrayList
- Passengers generated, put in a Passenger master ArrayList, and in movingPax ArrayList

Different way to handle updating objects

- if object has not made it to destination, whatever that is, keep in list, being updated
- reduces copies and makes program run faster
- Problem: making a shallow copy
    - use Object object = new Object();
    - Object cloneObject = new Object(object);

Need to figure out how to generate flights
- Not sure how to determine the start time of flights
     - max amount of time it could take for a passenger to get to their gate
        - 85 minutes is maximum amount of time from drop off to at gate
        - need to consider how long it could take for the last passenger to be generated
        - give passengers of first flight 2 hours to make it to their plane
